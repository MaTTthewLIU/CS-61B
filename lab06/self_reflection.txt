You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: resize() method because it makes method becomes more efficient. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:  Get method, because i make some extra code into the get method. 

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I learn about the logic of the ArrayDeque working. 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I would want to know how to work on the resize method. Cause it takes me a long to think about this method. 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I feel proud of my constructor. I am setting up Node well, then I am going smooth to writing other methods. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I think it will be the getrecurisive method since I create extra step for helping me finish  this method. 

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I am learning how the LinkedListDeque working. 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I would want to know how the tolist method working. 

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I like it. It helps me know how to write my code more elegant. I think it is perfect, there is nothing need to change.
